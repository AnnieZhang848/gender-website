		<p class="text">
            Now if you aren't very familiar with microlables, or if you don't know that much about queer identities in general, you might not recognize all these
            flags. No worries, I'm happy to explain them. You can find all the ones I used, listed below and with a brief explanation on what it means.<br><br>

            Keep in mind that this is by no means a comprehensive list of gender identities. These are just the ones that I happen to relate to the most.

                    <h3>Transgender</h2>
                    <p>An umbrella term to refer to anyone who identifies with a gender other than the one that they were assigned at birth.</p>

                    <h3>Non Binary</h2>
                    <p>An umbrella term to refer to anyone who's gender identity does not fit into the gender binary.
                        In other words, anything that isn't strictly "Man" or "Woman".</p>

                    <h3>Genderfluid</h2>
                    <p>An identity refering to someone who's gender changes over time. It can change between different genders depending on the individual. For example,
                        some genderfluid people only switch between man and woman, while others might fluctuate between non-binary identities.</p>

                    <h3>Genderqueer</h2>
                    <p>A very broad umbrella term to refer to anyone who's gender identity and/or expression is not easily defined by society's gender norms.</p>

                    <h3>Agender</h2>
                    <p>An identity refering to those who do not align with any gender at all. This identity overlaps with non binary, but people who identify as
                        non binary can still have a strong gender identity, just not one that fits into the gender binary. Meanwhile, agender people often describe feeling
                        a lack of gender, or a disconect from the concept of gender.</p>

                    <h3>Pangender</h2>
                    <p>An identity refering to someone who identifies with all genders siumltaneously or throughout their life. Depending on personal interpretation,
                        this identity can have overlap with genderfluid, but it doesn't have to. Words are what you make of them after all and the English language is
                        ever changing.</p>
