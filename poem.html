		<p class="poem">
            My gender is a planet<br>
            More specifically it is Pluto<br>
            I suppose it's not really accurate to call Pluto a planet anymore though is it<br>
            Technically, scientifically, it isn't one<br>
            Because it doesn't do the things a planet is supposed to do<br>
            But it's been a planet for so long<br>
            And sometimes, when enough people treat it like a planet<br>
            We can pretend it is a planet again<br><br>

            So it's not really accurate to call me a girl<br>
            Even though technically, socially, I am a girl<br>
            Because I don't do the things girls are supposed to do<br>
            And sometimes, when people first meet me, they treat me like a boy<br>
            Or they can't decide<br>
            Or it's not other people at all and it's just me<br>
            Who wants to cut my hair and wear makeup and flirt with girls and fall for boys and be a mystery and a ghost<br>
            Maybe then I am something else<br><br>

            You know they had to invent a whole new category just for Pluto<br>
            Dwarf planets<br>
            But Pluto doesn't care, does it<br>
            All these little boxes made by human beings to try and contain the infinity of space<br>
            And just because they put other things into the box labelled dwarf planet later doesn't make it any more or less real<br>
            Pluto is just Pluto<br><br>

            And things like girl and boy are also just that<br>
            Little boxes made by little people a long time ago and a long ways away<br>
            And yes there are people who choose to stay outside of the boxes but maybe I don't even know what a box is<br>
            Maybe I'm just Pluto<br>
            Maybe I don't want words<br><br>

            My sexuality is like a colour<br>
            Maybe it's magenta, or teal, or purple, or grey but it's definitely a colour<br>
            Some people will try to tell you that all you need are the primary colours<br>
            They'll argue for you to stick to blue and red and yellow<br>
            But a computer's primary colours are cyan and magenta and yellow and black<br>
            And maybe our eyes see yellow and red and blue and green because how would you feel about calling green blueish yellow?<br><br>

            So I am asexual and that's more than just a shade of normal<br>
            And I'm panromantic which is not just a mixture of half this and half that<br>
            And I have all these little details that are needed to form my painting<br>
            Like demi, and queer<br>
            I mean, you would never tell navy to go home just because you already have sky<br>
            Maybe I am exactly what I say I am<br>
            Nothing more nothing less<br>
            Maybe I need words to keep me grounded<br><br>

            Yes my gender is a planet and my sexuality is a colour and these things can coexist<br>
            You too can be a planet<br>
            Or a colour<br>
            Or both<br>
            Or neither<br><br>

            Maybe your gender is a shape<br>
            Strictly defined but with room for building<br>
            And maybe your sexuality is a puzzle<br>
            The picture is you but each piece is just as important as the end product<br><br>

            Maybe you have just the words to explain it<br>
            Or maybe, you end up just rambling about colours and space<br>
            But at least I exist<br>
            And I think that's good enough for now
