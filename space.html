            Okay this one I will actually explain, if only because the meaning behind it is a personal one. Pretty unsurprisingly, this isn't the first time
            I've tried to make something artistic to explain my gender identity and expression. So the background on this website is a reference to a poem I wrote
            some time ago about this topic.<br><br>
            
            Well, technically it's two poems in one I suppose. Titled "My Gender is a Planet/My Sexuality is a Color". If you're interested, you can find the poem
            <a href="poem.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Although keep in mind that it is a little outdated and not everything mentioned is entirely accurate to me anymore.
            Which is fine, the sentiment is there and that's really the point. I'm not going to edit it to represent me now or anything, because I think it's important to
            acknowledge and embrace our past "phases". You know? I also apologize in advance for any scientific inaccuracies regarding planets. I'm not an astronomer, I just
            think Pluto deserves better.
